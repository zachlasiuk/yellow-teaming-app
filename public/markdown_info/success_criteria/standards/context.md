# Standards

## Overview

AI systems are not exempt from meeting technical and legal standards for safe product deployment. The standards you'll have to meet depend on the geography and industry you operate in. 

Technical standards include ISO/IEC, IEEE, and OpenChain specifications. Legal standards include AI-specific laws, data protection, sector-specific regulation, anti-discrimiation laws, and more. 

Following these standards may seem tedious. However, note that the road to regulation is often paved by blood. They exist for a reason, protecting human life and/or rights.
