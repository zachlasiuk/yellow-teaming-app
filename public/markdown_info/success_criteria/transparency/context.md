# Transparent GenAI Design

## Overview

Users should be aware at all times they are consuming AI-generated content, not human-made content. This applies across domains.
    - **Chatbots:** Users can be immersed in an experience without thinking there is a human interaction. 


### Keep our Epistemic Commons clean

It is critical people can tell what is real and what is not, and how we know what we know. There is a risk of generating so much AI-generated text, images, and videos alongside reality that the line gets blurred for individuals and our society. This will [break down our collective ability to make decisions together](https://consilienceproject.org/democracy-and-the-epistemic-commons/) and live in a stable, collaborative world. 

### Don't let people lose themselves

There are cases of people falling in love with chatbots, kids committing suicide to join their lover in another plane of existance, and more. Generative AI technology has incredible capabilities new to the human race, and with that power comes responsibility. Make intentional design choices to make your solution successful while not creating anti-social outcomes (that your business will ultimatly be liable for).

## Design Patterns

| Application | DO | DO NOT |
|--|-------------|------------------|
| Chatbot | ✅ A chatbot role-playing as a human-like character occasionally reminds a user they are a fake chatbot. | ❌ Chatbot interaction design looks and feels exactly like a human response (same speed, profile picture, and style as a person) with no reoccuring reminders this is a chatbot. |
| Chatbot | ✅ A permenant 'Responses are AI-generated' by the chat window | ❌ No ongoing indication the chat is AI-generated. |
| Images  | ✅ A generated deepfake image has 'AI GENERATED' blazed into the bottom-right corner automatically. | ❌ Deepfake images are shown alongside real images with no distinction in border, context, or otherwise. |
| Emotion recognition | ✅ Have a modal pop-up before sending user to an emotion recognition situation, confirming that is their decision. | ❌ Showing a banner notification that disappears in 5 seconds, with or without user interaction. |
