questions:
  - If you value representing society accuratly in a social media platform, how would this influence the way you design your promotion algorithms? Defaulting to engagement metrics might amplify the loudest voices, but not necessarily the most representative ones. 
  - Are we building technology that's training us to interrupt each other and ourselves? To thinking more about ourselves over others?
  - If technologists don't choose wisely, what happens when a polarizing, self-centered training process runs on society for years?
