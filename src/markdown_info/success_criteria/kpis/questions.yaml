questions:
  - The volume of human communication happening through tweets is growing. How might a disproportionate increase in short, attention-grabbing opinions shape our capacity for nuanced discourse?
  - Gmail uses predictive modeling (based on previously gathered data) to autocomplete full sentences of emails for us. As people grow more reliant on this feature, how might that influence their self-expression or creativity? What part of ourselves atrophies due to the autocompletion predictions?
  - Would you be willing to get up and defend an important product decision to the stakeholders most negatively impacted by it? If you were one of those stakeholders, would you trust the people who made that decision?
  - How do you invest in improving relationships among the different parts of your system as opposed to optimizing each part of the system individually? (remember, optimizing parts doesnâ€™t always lead to optimization of the whole, especially in complex systems).
