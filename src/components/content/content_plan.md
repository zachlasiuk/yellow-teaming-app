# Content Plan

Decision1: Compliance and/or Responsibility
- I think tying them together is essential, otherwise ppl will chery pick.

Plan: List COMPLIANCE steps, RESPONSIBILITY action plans, then combine.





## Responsible AI
1. Anti-KPIs
2. Nth order impact assessments
    - 1st order: Direct goals of system
    - Nth order: Externality Mapping exercise (systems thinking example)
    - Nth order specifics: 
        - Human capabilities (individual & social)...aligning with your values?
        - Human thriving (individual & social)
        - Human vulnerabilities (individual & social aka group dynamics, collaboration, etc)

## Plan   
1. My Values, Goals, Metrics
    a. Your Values (context on different value systems, and universal values: Collaboration, etc.)
    b. Product goals (any affected stakeholders with a say on goals/features?)
    c. Product KPIs (and anti-kpis)
    d. Technical Standards (required for high-risk providers)
    e. Legal Standards (checkbox for options: AI-specific laws, data-specific like GDPR, sector-specific like HIPAA, or general laws like anti-discrimination)

2. Designing Responsibly
    a. Communicate to users whend dealing with AI synthetic content, biometrics, etc. (Accountability.12)
        - Transparency and accounability: Enable users to seek redress for incorrect or problematic AI system outcomes.

    b. Communicate UNCERTAINTY (209 Yval Harari book)
    b. BIAS in datasets
    c. User Privacy
    b. ..........other actionable responsible design things here that they can check if they've done!



3. Assessing Impacts
    a. 1st order: Direct goals of system
    b. Nth order: Externality Mapping exercise (systems thinking example)
        MAN 1.4 -> Document negative residual risks
    c. Nth order specifics: 
        - Human capabilities (individual & social)...aligning with your values?
        - Human thriving (individual & social)
        - Human vulnerabilities (individual & social aka group dynamics, vulnerable groups like under 18YO (Article 9.9), societal collaboration, etc)

4. Measuring Impacts          (Harms & Risks & + and - impacts)
    a. PreDeploy Test Strategy (Measure.6)
    b. PreDeploy Tests (Measure.4)
    c. PostDeploy Monitor Strategy (Measure.5 & Measure.6, Mitigation.7 requirement)
        - Include Error & Incident track/reporting (Mitigtaion.8)
        - Include documentation requirements (Accountability.11 - documentation)
    d. PostDeploy Mitigation Strategy (Mitigation.9) 
    e. Measurement Methods/Tools used (metrics, datasets, etc) (Measuring.6)


5. Successful Structures
    a. What Human-In-The-Loop oversight exists (Mitiation.7, ResponsibleAI value alignment)
    b. Policies for data & governance (Accountability.10)
    c. Roles for risk management (Accountability.10)
