# Synergistic Design

## Overview

Synergistic satisfiers are solutions to problems that address multiple needs at the same time. This simple principle can be applied to how we design new tools and products. By looking for synergy between solutions to disparate problems—or approaches that give rise to multiple positive externalities from a single intervention—we can expand the breadth of our gaze to include more than just the narrow, product-focused pipeline of typical technology design. Businesses that embrace synergistic design not only create more effective solutions but also reduce inefficiencies, improve user satisfaction, and gain a competitive advantage by solving multiple challenges at once.

### Design for compounding benefits

Traditional technology development often focuses on solving a single problem at a time, missing opportunities to create solutions that address multiple challenges simultaneously. For example, privacy-preserving AI models not only enhance user trust but also reduce compliance risks and improve system security. Thoughtful design choices that consider broader social, ethical, and operational benefits create products that stand the test of time and maximize positive impact.

### Avoid siloed problem-solving

A narrow focus on isolated issues can lead to unintended consequences and missed opportunities for innovation. Instead of building features in isolation, teams should actively seek areas where a single design choice can address multiple concerns—such as accessibility features that also improve usability for all users, or explainable AI systems that both enhance user trust and satisfy regulatory requirements. By integrating synergistic design principles, businesses can create more resilient, adaptable, and impactful products.

## Design Patterns

| Application            | Example of Synergistic Design                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content Curation     | ✅ A social media offering multiple algorithm approach allows users to curate content, increasing user control, diversity, and mitigating issues of bias and imperfect moderation in a single intervention. |
| Accessibility        | ✅ Voice-to-text features improve accessibility for users with disabilities while also benefiting those in noisy environments or multitasking. |
| Privacy & Security  | ✅ End-to-end encryption not only protects user privacy but also strengthens overall security against cyber threats. |
| Explainability      | ✅ AI transparency tools that provide explanations for decisions both improve user trust and satisfy emerging regulatory requirements. |
| Energy Efficiency   | ✅ Cloud-based computing that dynamically optimizes energy consumption both reduces costs and decreases environmental impact. |
