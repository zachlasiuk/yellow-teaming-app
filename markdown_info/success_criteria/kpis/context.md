# KPIs and Anti-KPIs

## Overview

> *When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure - Goodhart’s Law*

Having clear Key Performance Indicators KPIs helps drive decision-making and improving solution features efficiently. Metrics like revenue, daily active users,  or time spent are common in the tech space. As we optimize for metrics, it is easy to lose sight of the original values the metrics were meant to support. 



**Don’t confuse what’s easily measurable with what matters.**

Having KPIs is a necessity. To ensure that optimizing your KPIs don’t lead to harm elsewhere, you can stay metrics-informed but values-driven. Here you will also match each KPI with an anti-KPI “measure of failure”.  An anti-KPI should list what is an unacceptable result even if a KPI goes up.
