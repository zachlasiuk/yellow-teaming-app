# Agentic Technology

## Overview

Agentic technology refers to systems designed to enhance human agency, ensuring that individuals remain in control of their decisions and interactions with digital systems. AI-driven tools, if designed without agency in mind, can override human intent, subtly manipulate choices, or create dependency, disempowering users in the process. Agentic technology, on the other hand, supports and amplifies human decision-making rather than replacing it. Failing to build for agency ultimately leads to disengaged users, loss of trust, and regulatory scrutiny, which can undermine long-term business success.

### Keep humans in the driver's seat

When systems make choices for people without transparency or meaningful user input, they erode autonomy. Over time, this can lead to learned helplessness, where individuals stop making choices altogether and defer entirely to algorithmic decision-making. This is dangerous at both an individual and societal level, reducing critical thinking, self-determination, and accountability. Moreover, businesses that remove human control risk alienating users, facing backlash, and encountering legal challenges as consumer protection laws evolve. Technology should facilitate human intent, not dictate it.

### Avoid dark patterns of control

Many digital systems today are designed to nudge, persuade, or outright coerce users into actions that benefit the business model rather than the user. From infinite scroll to manipulative UI/UX choices, these patterns erode agency and reduce people to passive consumers rather than active participants. While these tactics may drive short-term engagement, they ultimately damage trust and lead to user fatigue, abandonment, and reputational harm. Instead, agentic technology should prioritize user empowerment by making choices explicit, reversible, and aligned with user goals.

## Design Patterns

| Application | DO | DO NOT |
|--|-------------|------------------|
| AI Assistants | ✅ Provide users with clear explanations and control over automation levels. | ❌ Automatically apply AI decisions without user consent or explanation. |
| Recommendations | ✅ Allow users to adjust recommendation algorithms to fit their preferences. | ❌ Keep recommendation systems opaque, providing no control over what is surfaced. |
| Personalization | ✅ Provide an intuitive way for users to reset, audit, or tweak personalized settings. | ❌ Lock users into personalized content without transparency or opt-out options. |
| Automation | ✅ Make automation an opt-in feature with clear user oversight. | ❌ Remove human decision-making by enforcing automation with no escape hatch. |
