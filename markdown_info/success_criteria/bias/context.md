# Bias in Technology

## Overview

Bias in technology arises through multiple channels. Without proactive mitigation strategies, bias in AI and software can perpetuate discrimination, reinforce harmful stereotypes, and create unjust outcomes. Addressing bias is not just a technical challenge but a fundamental responsibility for ethical and effective product development. It also avoids extramly costly reputational harm for bad press events, and ultimatly is bad business by not serving your full target audience in the best way possible. 

### Understand how bias enters the system

Bias is often introduced through:
- **Human designer bias:** Unconscious or systemic biases in decision-making during product development.
- **Training data bias:** AI models learn from historical data, which may reflect and amplify societal inequities.
- **Algorithmic bias:** Poorly designed models can disproportionately impact different user groups.
- **Feedback loop bias:** Systems that adjust based on user behavior can reinforce existing biases over time.

Recognizing these sources of bias allows designers to take preemptive action to create more equitable systems.

### Avoid amplifying bias through automation

Unchecked biases in automated decision-making can have severe consequences, from discriminatory hiring practices to biased lending algorithms and unfair law enforcement applications. Ensuring fairness requires:
- Regular audits of datasets for representational imbalances.
- Transparency in how models are trained and deployed.
- Mechanisms for user feedback and correction when biases are detected.
- Cross-disciplinary review processes to mitigate risks before deployment.

Businesses that fail to address bias face reputational damage, regulatory fines, and loss of user trust. A proactive approach to fairness benefits both society and the sustainability of digital products.

## Design Patterns

| Application           | DO                                                   | DO NOT                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI Hiring Tools      | ✅ Regularly audit datasets to ensure diverse representation in hiring recommendations. | ❌ Use historical hiring data without addressing systemic biases.       |
| Content Moderation  | ✅ Use diverse human oversight teams to evaluate AI decisions and reduce bias impact.   | ❌ Rely solely on AI moderation without transparency or recourse.       |
| Facial Recognition   | ✅ Test models on diverse datasets to avoid racial and gender disparities in accuracy.  | ❌ Deploy facial recognition without auditing for demographic bias.     |
| Recommendation Systems | ✅ Allow users to adjust algorithmic filtering to counteract biased content curation.  | ❌ Implement opaque recommendation systems that reinforce filter bubbles. |
| Predictive Analytics | ✅ Implement fairness constraints in AI models to prevent discrimination in decision-making. | ❌ Design AI-driven predictions that disadvantage marginalized groups.  |
