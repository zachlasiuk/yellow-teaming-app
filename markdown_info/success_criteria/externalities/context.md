# Nth-order Consequences

## Overview

1st order consequences are the impacts your direct product consequences have on your users, society, and the world. 2nd order consequences are the impacts of these 1st order consequences, and so on. 

These impacts are often negative, long-term, and unintended. A common term is **Negative Externalities**. However, this hides the cost these unintended, indirect consequences have on your business. 

> Nth-order consequences are unintended and indirect, but have a real cost on your business.

This section walks you through how to analyze Nth-order consequences of your system design and implementation decisions.


## How your company sees costs of negative externalities
These costs don't appear in P&L statements. However, they erode trust, increase risk, and harm long-term viability.

- Reputational harm: You can destroy your brand credibility leading to loss of users. Meta's Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal led to a drop in user trust and impacted engagement, ad revenue, and stock price.

- Investor conficence loss: Boeing 737 MAX Crashes - Increasing short-term profits due to cost cutting on testing led to $20+ billion loss in market value and long-term reputational crisis.

- Remediation costs: Fixing harms after deployment is far more expensive than designing responsibly from the start. Tobacco companies were forced to pay billions in anti-smoking campaigns due to their negative health effects on users.

- Environmental sustainablity: Failing to respect natural limits of our environment can backfire as sustainability grows in public support and becomes more economically viable. In 2021 BlackRock revoked investments from companies with unethical environmental practices, who previously enjoyed larger profit margins. 

- Mental health: Social media has worsed body image issues, particularly for teenager girls. This, alongside their addictive and attention-span-shortening qualities, is leading to smartphone banning in schools (lowering app usage, impacting revenue).

- Supply chain disruption: Pushing externalities onto your supply chain can cause significant disruption. In 2022 Indonesia saw widespread worker strickes in nickle mines due to poor working conditions that slowed production for EV batter makers. 

- Undermining your own business model: Your product could be undermining your business model over time. For example, streaming services raced to create exlusive content which led to unsustainable costs, leading to mass layoffs and price hikes driving away consumers.

> Companies are made up of people. If you care, your company cares.

## Assessing Externality rubric
1. Scale: How widespread will the externality be?
2. Stakes: Is the impact irreversible for example?
3. Vulnerability: How exposed to harm is the group/system impacted?
4. Costs: If left unaddressed, who will bear the cost? How costly will it be?
5. Path to reduction: How might less of this externality be created?
